Player includes picture-in-picture, full-screen, Google Cast, and other settings (replay, accessibility) by default  
Basic Features:  
Same as other player plugins, just with a different player framework.  


Note on YouTube Videos:  
Unlike the default Vidstack setup, YouTube videos use an iframe. I think using an iframe is sufficient and there's no need to load an additional module.
